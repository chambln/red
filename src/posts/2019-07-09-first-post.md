Example post
------------

This is an example post.
Write your posts in pandoc's markdown format.

### Mathematical notation

By default, Pandoc renders TeX equations as best it can with just
unicode and html.
$$ e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta. $$

It also supports JavaScript libraries like MathJax, you'd just have to
edit the Makefile to give Pandoc the appropriate command-line arguments.
