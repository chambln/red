In this post, I've not specified a `date` variable for pandoc, but the
Makefile still orders the posts by alphabetical order of their
filenames.
If you name your files with the dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format at the
beginning of the filename, it will render them in chronological order,
which is probably what you're after.
